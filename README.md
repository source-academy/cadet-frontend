# Cadet Frontend 

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/source-academy/cadet-frontend.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/source-academy/cadet-frontend)
[![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/source-academy/cadet-frontend/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://coveralls.io/github/source-academy/cadet-frontend?branch=master)

The Source Academy is a gamified platform designed to teach students coding while having fun! This repository in particular houses the source code for the frontend written in ReactJS with Redux.

## Features
- Playground to write and test programs
- Built-in Debugger and Visualiser to interact with your programs
- Missions/Quests/Contests to solve challenging problems while learning about programming fundamentals
- Sessions for collaborative programming
- Grading System to test your programs and marking

## Getting Started

### Installation 
1. Install a stable version of NodeJS (tested: Node 10.15.0).
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
3. Copy the `.env.example` file as `.env` and set the necessary variables (refer below for more information)
4. Run `npm start` to start the server at `localhost:8075`. 

### Setting up your environment

The project requires some environment variables to be set to work properly. In the `.env` file a few things need to be set-up:

1. **REACT_APP_LUMINUS_CLIENT_ID** : This is needed for the login to work at the moment. Contact the team to obtain one!
2. **REACT_APP_USE_BACKEND**: Set to false if not running together with the [backend](https://github.com/source-academy/cadet). Take note that CORs has to be handled if running with the backend
3. **REACT_APP_CHATKIT_INSTANCE_LOCATOR**: Set this up if running with chatkit. Its documentation can be found [here](https://pusher.com/docs/chatkit).

### Running the tests 

Before pushing to Github, ensure that your code is formatted and your tests are passing. These two commands should help with that:

- `npm run format` : formats your code
- `npm run test`: runs the tests and prints the output
