[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/source-academy/cadet-frontend.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/source-academy/cadet-frontend)
[![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/source-academy/cadet-frontend/badge.svg?branch=travis)](https://coveralls.io/github/source-academy/cadet-frontend?branch=travis)

## Development Setup

1. Install a stable version of Yarn and NodeJS (use node version 4-9 with nvm).
2. Run `yarn` to install dependencies.
3. Copy the `.env.example` file as `.env` and set the variable `REACT_APP_IVLE_KEY`
   to contain your IVLE Lapi key.
4. Run `yarn start` to start the server at `localhost:80`. Admin permissions may
   be required for your OS to serve at port 80.
   
## IVLE LAPI Key
For NUS students, you can access your IVLE LAPI key [here](https://ivle.nus.edu.sg/LAPI/default.aspx).

## For Windows Users
In package.json, change line 19:\
"start-js": "rm -r coverage; BROWSER=none PORT=80 react-scripts-ts start",\
to:\
"start-js": "set PORT=80 & react-scripts-ts start",\

## For Testing of js-slang

1. For now, use the branch 'update-js-slang' in cadet-frontend
2. Follow the instructions on js-slang to transpile your own copy
3. Edit line 41 of package.json in this project to link to the directory of your js-slang and then run `yarn`:

`"js-slang": "file:path/to/js-slang",`

Note that this copies your files over, any future changes will not be reflected.
