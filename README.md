The Source Academy is a gamified platform designed to teach students coding while having fun! This repository in particular houses the source code for the frontend written in ReactJS with Redux.

## Features
- Playground to write and test programs
- Built-in Debugger and Visualiser to interact with your programs
- Missions/Quests/Contests to solve challenging problems while learning about programming fundamentals
- Sessions for collaborative programming
- Grading System to test your programs and marking

## Getting Started

### Installation 
1. Install a stable version of NodeJS (tested: Node 10.15.0).
2. Clone this repository and navigate to it using "cd" in your command line or shell tool.
3. Run `npm install` to install dependencies. (Running `audit fix` may prevent server from starting)
4. Copy the `.env.example` file as `.env` and set the necessary variables (refer below for more information)
5. Run `npm start` to start the server at `localhost:8075`.

### Setting up your environment

The project requires some environment variables to be set to work properly. In the `.env` file a few things need to be set-up:

1. **REACT_APP_LUMINUS_CLIENT_ID** : This is needed for the login to work at the moment.*
2. **REACT_APP_USE_BACKEND**: Set to false if not running together with the [backend](https://github.com/source-academy/cadet). Take note that CORs has to be handled if running with the backend
3. **REACT_APP_CHATKIT_INSTANCE_LOCATOR**: Set this up if running with chatkit. Its documentation can be found [here](https://pusher.com/docs/chatkit).

 \*If you require access to Luminus keys please email Prof Henz at henz@comp.nus.edu.sg to request for a with the email subject heading "Request for Luminus API Keys".
 
## Development
  
### Running the tests 

Before pushing to Github, ensure that your code is formatted and your tests are passing. These two commands should help with that:

- `npm run format` : formats your code
- `npm run test`: runs the tests and prints the output

### Running your own js-slang

See [js-slang README](https://github.com/source-academy/js-slang#using-your-js-slang-in-local-source-academy) for instructions how to run your own js-slang in the cadet-frontend.

### Development of Source Academy 2021

The development of Source Academy 2021 is on-going. Use the branch `sa_2021` in this repository for your pull requests. The tip of branch `sa_2021` in `cadet-frontend` is automatically deployed as [https://source-academy.github.io/](https://source-academy.github.io/).
