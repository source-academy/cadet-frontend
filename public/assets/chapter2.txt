$narrator
The year is 1101 A.E.
Exponential advances in technology have allowed the human race to traverse light years’ worth of distances in mere hours.
#changeBackground: classroom
As Earth’s population reached a breaking point, humans began to migrate across the galaxy, colonizing planets once thought uninhabitable, as well as making settlements on those with amicable alien life.
To supplement this rapid expansion, large space stations scattered throughout the solar systems began to emerge, serving as hubs for different human needs.

Here, students learn how to harness the power of an invisible force known as the Source, a hidden energy that lets one manipulate the things around them and perform great feats.

$narrator
The strange alien voice startles you. You were so preoccupied you hadn't even noticed the telebay's operator. This is your first time meeting an alien in person. You couldn't help but gawk at him, lost for words.
$scottie happy
If you exit through that door, the elevator will take you up to the hallway. From there you can access the rest of the ship. Follow the sign at the end of the corridor and you'll find the student quarters. Off you go now!
$you
Oh, um, thanks!
$narrator
You hastily make for the door, feeling a little embarassed.
You exit the elevator into a long hallway leading to various rooms. You look around for a sign leading to the student quarters.
$you
Ah, there it is! I can't wait to unload my stuff. It's killing my back. I guess I should've packed lighter.
