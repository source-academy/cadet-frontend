$narrator
The strange alien voice startles you. You were so preoccupied you hadn't even noticed the telebay's operator. This is your first time meeting an alien in person. You couldn't help but gawk at him, lost for words.

If you exit through that door, the elevator will take you up to the hallway. From there you can access the rest of the ship. Follow the sign at the end of the corridor and you'll find the student quarters. Off you go now!
$you
Oh, um, thanks!
$narrator
You hastily make for the door, feeling a little embarassed.
You exit the elevator into a long hallway leading to various rooms. You look around for a sign leading to the student quarters.
$you
Ah, there it is! I can't wait to unload my stuff. It's killing my back. I guess I should've packed lighter.
